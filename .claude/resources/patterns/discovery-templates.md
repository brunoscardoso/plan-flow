## Question Format Examples

### Functional Requirements Questions

```markdown
Questions

1. Should workflow steps be editable after creation?
   A Yes, users can edit title and content at any time
   B Yes, but only before the workflow is published
   C No, steps are immutable once created

2. What is the maximum number of steps per workflow?
   A 10 steps
   B 20 steps
   C Unlimited
   D Other (please specify)
```

### Technical Questions

```markdown
Questions

1. Which real-time update mechanism should we use?
   A SSE (Server-Sent Events) - simpler, one-way
   B WebSocket - full duplex, more complex
   C Polling - simple but less efficient

2. Should we use optimistic updates for better UX?
   A Yes, with rollback on failure
   B No, wait for server confirmation
```

### UI/UX Questions

```markdown
Questions

1. Where should this feature live in the UI?
   A New dedicated page
   B Sidebar panel
   C Modal dialog
   D Inline in existing page

2. What loading state should we show?
   A Skeleton loader
   B Spinner
   C Progress bar
```

## Referenced Documents Analysis Example

```markdown
## Referenced Documents Analysis

I've reviewed the following documents:

### API Contract (`flow/references/api-contracts.md`)

- Endpoint: POST /api/agents/{agentId}/workflow
- Request schema: WorkflowStepInput[]
- Response: WorkflowStep[]
- Authentication: Bearer token required

### SSE Events (`flow/references/sse-events.md`)

- Event types: plan_start, plan_step, plan_complete
- Payload structure: { stepId, status, content }

## Questions Based on Documents

1. The API contract shows `WorkflowStepInput` but doesn't define the `condition` field. Is this optional?
2. SSE events mention `plan_step` but not error handling. What happens on failure?
```

## Requirements Gathering Example

```markdown
## Requirements Gathered

### From API Contract (`flow/references/api-contracts.md`)

**Functional Requirements**:

- [FR-1]: Create workflow steps via POST /api/agents/{agentId}/workflow
- [FR-2]: Each step must have title, content, and sequence
- [FR-3]: Steps can have optional connectors and actions

**Non-Functional Requirements**:

- [NFR-1]: API response time < 500ms
- [NFR-2]: Support concurrent editing (optimistic updates)

**Constraints**:

- [C-1]: Maximum 20 steps per workflow
- [C-2]: Must use existing authentication flow

### From SSE Events (`flow/references/sse-events.md`)

**Functional Requirements**:

- [FR-4]: Real-time updates via SSE events
- [FR-5]: Events include: plan_start, plan_step, plan_complete

**Non-Functional Requirements**:

- [NFR-3]: SSE connection must auto-reconnect on failure
```

## Risks and Unknowns

### Technical Risks

| Risk                       | Impact | Mitigation                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| SSE connection instability | High   | Implement reconnection with exponential backoff       |
| State sync issues          | Medium | Use server as source of truth, reconcile on reconnect |

### Requirements Risks

| Risk                        | Impact | Mitigation                        |
| --------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Scope creep on step editing | Medium | Define MVP scope clearly in plan  |
| Unclear error handling      | High   | Clarify with user before planning |

### Unknowns (Need Investigation)

- [ ] Backend pagination support for large workflows
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness requirements
- [ ] Accessibility requirements for drag-and-drop

## Code Context Analysis Example

```markdown
## Code Context Analysis

I performed a comprehensive search for all code related to "user profile" functionality:

### Components Found

| File | Usage | Line(s) |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/components/UserProfile/index.tsx` | Main profile display component | - |
| `src/components/UserProfile/EditForm.tsx` | Profile editing form | - |
| `src/components/Settings/ProfileSettings.tsx` | Settings page integration | - |
| `src/components/Dashboard/UserCard.tsx` | Dashboard summary card | 45-78 |
| `src/components/Navigation/UserMenu.tsx` | Navigation menu with profile link | 23-35 |

### API Endpoints Found

| File | Endpoint | Method |
|------|----------|--------|
| `src/app/api/user/profile/route.ts` | `/api/user/profile` | GET, PUT |
| `src/app/api/user/avatar/route.ts` | `/api/user/avatar` | POST |
| `src/app/api/user/settings/route.ts` | `/api/user/settings` | GET, PATCH |

### State Management Found

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/stores/userStore.ts` | User profile state with actions |
| `src/stores/authStore.ts` | Includes user profile data from auth |

### Type Definitions Found

| File | Types |
|------|-------|
| `src/types/user.ts` | `User`, `UserProfile`, `UpdateProfileInput` |
| `src/types/rest-inputs.ts` | `UpdateProfileRequestSchema` (Zod) |

### Other Related Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/utils/userValidation.ts` | Profile data validation utilities |
| `src/hooks/useUserProfile.ts` | Custom hook for profile management |

**Total References**: 12 files across 5 categories

### Key Patterns Observed

- **View/Logic Separation**: Components use separate logic hooks (e.g., `useUserProfileLogic.internal.ts`)
- **Zod Validation**: All API inputs validated with Zod schemas in `types/rest-inputs.ts`
- **State Management**: Using Zustand stores with immer for immutable updates
- **Error Handling**: Consistent use of custom error types (`BadRequestError`, `UnauthorizedError`)
- **Testing**: Each component has co-located `*.client.test.ts` file
```

## Proposed Approach Example

```markdown
## Proposed Approach

Based on the requirements gathered, the recommended approach is:

1. **Extend existing agent section**: Build on `AgentPlanSection` rather than creating new component
2. **Use SSE for real-time updates**: Leverage existing streaming infrastructure
3. **Implement optimistic updates**: Better UX with immediate feedback
4. **Follow view/logic separation**: As per codebase patterns

### Approach Alternatives Considered

| Approach  | Pros                   | Cons                       | Recommendation  |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| WebSocket | Full duplex            | Overkill for this use case | Not recommended |
| SSE       | Simple, existing infra | One-way only               | Recommended     |
| Polling   | Simple                 | Poor UX, wasteful          | Not recommended |
```
