## Critical Rules

| Rule                     | Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep Analysis**        | Sample real code - don't just detect dependencies        |
| **Real Examples**        | Pattern files must include actual code from the project  |
| **Research Best Practices** | Use web search to get current best practices         |
| **Interactive Questions** | Use Plan mode Questions UI to confirm patterns          |
| **User Confirmation**    | Always confirm detected patterns before generating files |
| **Complete and Stop**    | After presenting results, STOP and wait for user         |

---

## Required Tools

This command uses the Interactive Questions Tool for user confirmation.

See: `.claude/resources/tools/interactive-questions-tool.md`

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Validate Context

Verify we're in a valid project directory:

1. Check for presence of dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. Check for source code directories (src/, app/, lib/, etc.)
3. If no project detected, inform user and ask for guidance

**If valid project found**, report initial findings:

```markdown
Found: [package.json/requirements.txt/etc.]
Source directories: [src/, app/, etc.]
Proceeding with deep analysis...
```

---

### Step 2: Initial Dependency Scan

Read dependency files completely:

1. Parse all dependencies with versions
2. Categorize: frameworks, libraries, dev tools
3. Identify the complete stack

**Report findings**:

```markdown
## Detected Stack

**Language**: [TypeScript/JavaScript/Python/etc.]
**Framework**: [Next.js/FastAPI/etc.]
**Key Libraries**:
- Validation: [Zod/Pydantic/etc.]
- State: [Zustand/Redux/etc.]
- ORM: [Prisma/SQLAlchemy/etc.]
- Testing: [Jest/Vitest/Pytest/etc.]
```

---

### Step 3: Deep Code Analysis

**CRITICAL**: This is where the real indexing happens.

For each detected library/framework:

1. **Find relevant files** using glob patterns
2. **Read 2-5 sample files** to understand usage
3. **Extract patterns**:
   - Import style
   - File organization
   - Naming conventions
   - Code structure
   - Usage patterns

**Document findings as you go**:

```markdown
## Analyzing [Library]...

**Files found**: X files matching pattern
**Sample files read**: [file1.ts], [file2.ts]

**Patterns detected**:
- Import: `import { x } from 'lib'`
- Location: `src/schemas/`
- Naming: `entitySchema`
```

---

### Step 4: Detect Project Conventions

Analyze the codebase for conventions:

1. **File Naming**: kebab-case, camelCase, PascalCase
2. **Directory Structure**: feature-based, layer-based, hybrid
3. **Import Patterns**: path aliases, barrel exports
4. **Component Structure**: co-located vs separated
5. **Error Handling**: patterns used
6. **Logging**: library or console

---

### Step 5: Research Best Practices

Use web search to get current best practices:

1. Search for `"[framework] best practices 2025"`
2. Search for `"[library] patterns"`
3. Compare with project patterns
4. Note recommendations

---

### Step 6: Check Existing Cursor Rules

Check for existing rules:

1. `.claude/rules/` directory
2. `.cursorrules` file
3. Note conflicts and overlaps

---

### Step 7: Ask Confirming Questions (Interactive)

**Use the Interactive Questions Tool to confirm detected patterns with the user.**

See: `.claude/resources/tools/interactive-questions-tool.md`

#### 7.1: Present Analysis Summary First

Before asking questions, present what was detected:

```markdown
## Project Analysis Complete

I analyzed your codebase and detected:

**Stack**: [Language] + [Framework]
**Key Libraries**: [Lib1], [Lib2], [Lib3]
**Architecture**: [Feature-based/Layer-based/etc.]

**Patterns Detected**:
1. [Pattern 1 with brief example]
2. [Pattern 2 with brief example]
3. [Pattern 3 with brief example]

**Conventions Detected**:
- File naming: [convention]
- Import style: [convention]
- Component structure: [convention]

Now I'll ask a few questions to confirm these patterns.
```

#### 7.2: Switch to Plan Mode

**MANDATORY**: Use `SwitchMode` tool to switch to Plan mode:

```
Use Claude Code native conversation flow for questions
```

#### 7.3: Ask Setup Questions

Use `Ask the user directly in conversation` tool for each question:

**Question 1: Stack Confirmation**

```
Ask the user directly in conversation({
  question: "I detected the following stack. Is this accurate?

[Framework]: [Detected framework]
[Language]: [Detected language]
[Key Libraries]: [List]",
  options: [
    "A. Yes, this is correct",
    "B. Partially correct - I'll clarify what's different",
    "C. No, let me describe the correct stack"
  ],
  explanation: "Confirming the detected technology stack"
})
```

**Question 2: Architecture Confirmation**

```
Ask the user directly in conversation({
  question: "I detected this architecture pattern:

[Detected pattern description]

Is this how your project is organized?",
  options: [
    "A. Yes, this is our architecture",
    "B. No, we use a different approach",
    "C. We're transitioning to a new architecture"
  ],
  explanation: "Understanding the project's architectural approach"
})
```

**Question 3: Pattern Enforcement**

```
Ask the user directly in conversation({
  question: "I found these coding patterns in your codebase. Which should I enforce?

1. [Pattern 1]
2. [Pattern 2]
3. [Pattern 3]",
  options: [
    "A. All detected patterns - they represent our standards",
    "B. Let me review and select which to keep",
    "C. These are legacy patterns - I'll describe preferred patterns"
  ],
  explanation: "Determining which patterns to document and enforce"
})
```

**Question 4: Strictness Level**

```
Ask the user directly in conversation({
  question: "How strictly should I enforce these patterns when generating code?",
  options: [
    "A. Strict - Always follow these patterns exactly",
    "B. Moderate - Follow patterns but allow exceptions with justification",
    "C. Loose - Use as guidelines, not requirements"
  ],
  explanation: "Setting the enforcement level for detected patterns"
})
```

**Question 5: Best Practices** (if recommendations found)

```
Ask the user directly in conversation({
  question: "I found some industry best practices your codebase could adopt:

1. [Recommendation 1]
2. [Recommendation 2]

Should I include these in the pattern files?",
  options: [
    "A. Yes, include them as recommendations",
    "B. No, only document current patterns",
    "C. Show me the full list first"
  ],
  explanation: "Deciding whether to include best practice recommendations"
})
```

**Question 6: Existing Rules** (only if existing cursor rules found)

```
Ask the user directly in conversation({
  question: "I found existing cursor rules in your project. How should I handle them?",
  options: [
    "A. Merge with new patterns (combine both)",
    "B. Replace with new patterns",
    "C. Keep existing rules, add new patterns separately",
    "D. Let me review the conflicts first"
  ],
  explanation: "Handling existing cursor rule files"
})
```

#### 7.4: Process Responses

After all questions are answered:

1. Extract selected options from each question
2. Map to corresponding answers
3. Document the confirmed patterns
4. Adjust pattern generation based on responses

#### 7.5: Switch Back to Agent Mode

**MANDATORY**: Use `SwitchMode` tool to return to Agent mode:

```
Use Claude Code native conversation flow for questions
```

---

### Step 8: Invoke Setup Skill

With confirmed patterns, the skill will:

1. Compile analysis into structured patterns based on user responses
2. Generate comprehensive pattern files with real examples
3. Create project analysis document
4. Update core pattern files

See: `.claude/resources/skills/setup-skill.md`

---

### Step 9: Create Flow Folder Structure

**Create the `flow/` directory structure for plan-flow artifacts.**

If the `flow/` folder doesn't exist, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p flow/archive flow/brain/features flow/brain/errors flow/contracts flow/discovery flow/plans flow/references flow/reviewed-code flow/reviewed-pr
```

**Add `.gitkeep` files**:

```bash
touch flow/archive/.gitkeep flow/brain/.gitkeep flow/contracts/.gitkeep flow/discovery/.gitkeep flow/plans/.gitkeep flow/references/.gitkeep flow/reviewed-code/.gitkeep flow/reviewed-pr/.gitkeep
```

**Directory Structure Created**:

```
flow/
├── archive/           # Completed/abandoned plans
├── brain/             # Automatic knowledge capture (Obsidian-compatible)
│   ├── features/      # Feature history and context
│   ├── errors/        # Reusable error patterns
│   └── sessions/      # Daily activity logs
├── contracts/         # Integration contracts
├── discovery/         # Discovery documents
├── plans/             # Active implementation plans
├── references/        # Reference materials + project_analysis.md
├── reviewed-code/     # Local code review documents
└── reviewed-pr/       # PR review documents
```

**Note**: Skip if directories already exist.

- X naming conventions identified
- X best practices documented

## Next Steps (user must invoke manually)

1. Review generated pattern files in `.claude/rules/`
2. Adjust any patterns that don't match your preferences
3. Start using plan-flow commands:
   - `/discovery-plan` - Explore a new feature
   - `/create-plan` - Create implementation plans
   - `/review-code` - Review local changes
```

**CRITICAL**: This command is now complete. STOP and wait for the user to invoke the next command.

## Example: Next.js + Zod + Zustand Project

**Detected Stack**:
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
- Validation: Zod
- State: Zustand
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Testing: Vitest

**Files Created**:

1. `.claude/rules/frameworks/nextjs-patterns.md`
   - App Router conventions
   - Server vs Client components
   - API route patterns
   - Metadata handling

2. `.claude/rules/libraries/zod-patterns.md`
   - Schema file location (`src/schemas/`)
   - Naming convention (`entitySchema`)
   - Real examples from codebase
   - Type inference patterns

3. `.claude/rules/libraries/zustand-patterns.md`
   - Store file location (`src/stores/`)
   - Store structure pattern
   - Selector patterns
   - Real examples from codebase

4. `.claude/rules/project/project-patterns.md`
   - Directory structure map
   - File naming conventions
   - Import order
   - Component structure
   - Error handling approach

## Context Loading

This command uses the **brain index** for context retrieval. Before executing, query the project brain for relevant documentation:

**Queries**:
- `planflow-ai state-query "project setup" --scope resources`
- `planflow-ai state-query "pattern generation" --scope resources`

The brain returns ranked chunks from indexed markdown files. Use the top results to inform execution.

## Related Resources

| Resource                       | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `setup-skill.md`              | Detailed execution logic               |
| `interactive-questions-tool.md` | Questions UI for confirmations       |
| `allowed-patterns.md`         | Core allowed patterns                  |
| `forbidden-patterns.md`       | Core forbidden patterns                |

---

## Global Pattern Sync

After generating pattern files in Step 8, sync **generic** patterns to the global brain at `~/plan-flow/brain/patterns/`.

### What to Sync

| Local Pattern File | Global Target | Sync? |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/resources/frameworks/<fw>-patterns.md` | `~/plan-flow/brain/patterns/<fw>.md` | Yes — framework best practices are generic |
| `.claude/resources/libraries/<lib>-patterns.md` | `~/plan-flow/brain/patterns/<lib>.md` | Yes — library patterns are generic |
| `.claude/resources/project/project-patterns.md` | — | No — project-specific paths and structure |

### Sync Process

For each framework and library pattern file generated:

1. Check if `~/plan-flow/brain/patterns/<name>.md` already exists
2. **If it does NOT exist**:
   - Copy the pattern file, but strip project-specific file paths and code examples that reference specific project directories
   - Keep generic best practices, conventions, allowed/forbidden patterns
   - Add a `## Projects Using This` section at the bottom: `- [[project-name]]`
3. **If it ALREADY exists**:
   - Read the existing global file
   - Append any NEW sections or patterns not already present (do NOT overwrite existing content — it may contain knowledge from other projects)
   - Add `[[project-name]]` to the `## Projects Using This` section if not already listed
4. Use kebab-case for file names: `nextjs.md`, `typescript.md`, `zod.md`, `react-query.md`

### Example

If setup generates `.claude/resources/frameworks/nextjs-patterns.md`, create or update `~/plan-flow/brain/patterns/nextjs.md` with the generic patterns, linked to the project via `[[project-name]]`.

## Brain Capture

After setup completes successfully, append a brain-capture block to the session file. See `.claude/resources/core/brain-capture.md` for processing rules.

**Capture the following**:

```
<!-- brain-capture
skill: setup
feature: project-setup
status: completed
data:
  project_name: [detected project name]
  stack: [language + framework]
  patterns_generated: [count of pattern files created]
  patterns_synced_to_global: [list of global pattern files created/updated]
  files_created: [list of generated files]
-->
```

Write to `~/plan-flow/brain/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and update `flow/brain/index.md` if this is a new project setup.

## Resource Capture

During this skill's execution, watch for valuable reference materials worth preserving. See `.claude/resources/core/resource-capture.md` for capture rules, file format, and naming conventions.

At natural break points, if you encounter information that could be useful for future development (API specs, architecture notes, config references, domain knowledge, etc.), ask the user: "I found something that could be useful for future reference: _{brief description}_. Should I save it to `flow/resources/`?"

Only save if the user approves. Do not re-ask if declined.
